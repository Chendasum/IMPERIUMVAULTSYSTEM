CAMBODIA AGRICULTURAL CLIMATE IMPACT ANALYSIS

Climate Context:
‚Ä¢ Temperature: Increasing 0.2¬∞C per decade
‚Ä¢ Rainfall: More irregular patterns, intense storms
‚Ä¢ Flooding: Annual Mekong floods affecting 1.5M people
‚Ä¢ Drought: Dry seasons becoming more severe
‚Ä¢ Sea Level: Rising 3mm/year affecting coastal agriculture

Agricultural Vulnerabilities:
‚Ä¢ Rice: Sensitive to temperature and water stress
‚Ä¢ Rubber: Declining yields in some regions
‚Ä¢ Fisheries: Changing water levels and temperatures
‚Ä¢ Coastal: Saltwater intrusion threatening farmland

Current Adaptation Efforts:
‚Ä¢ Climate-resilient rice varieties development
‚Ä¢ Early warning systems implementation
‚Ä¢ Improved irrigation infrastructure
‚Ä¢ Crop diversification programs

Analysis Requirements:

1. **Risk Assessment by Sector**
   - Quantify climate risks for each major crop
   - Identify most vulnerable regions
   - Timeline for impact escalation

2. **Adaptation Strategies**
   - Technology solutions available
   - Cost-benefit analysis of adaptations
   - Best practice examples from region

3. **Investment Needs**
   - Infrastructure resilience improvements
   - Research and development priorities
   - Farmer training and support programs

4. **Opportunity Identification**
   - Climate-smart agriculture potential
   - Carbon credit opportunities
   - Sustainable intensification benefits

5. **Policy Framework**
   - Regulatory support needs
   - International cooperation opportunities
   - Financing mechanism requirements

Focus on actionable climate adaptation strategies for agricultural resilience.
